# Online-Trajectory-Generation-With-MPC-for-Non-Holonomic-Robots
Working on model predictive control  to control a group of multiple mobile robots and generate online trajectories in real time while avoiding collision with static point obstacles and other robots. On-demand Collision avoidance method is used to avoid collision and a replanning strategy is to be used to avoid disturbances to the system.
