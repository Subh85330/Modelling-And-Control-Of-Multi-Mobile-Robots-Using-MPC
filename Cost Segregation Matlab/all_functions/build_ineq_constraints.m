% Multiplying the decision vector X times Sigma_acc gives acc control pts
% We define a delta_acc that converts acc control points into polynomials
Beta_acc = mat_bernstein2power(d-2, l, ndim);

% Define Tau_acc that evaluates the polynomial at different times
% Define the times at which we desire to sample between 0s and 2.4s
% NOTE: Always constrain the first
